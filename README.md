For this mini-project, I have deconstructed an existing web page and rebuilt it.
The links don't go anywhere and the search box doesn't do anything when you submit it.
It is built using HTML and CSS purely.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
